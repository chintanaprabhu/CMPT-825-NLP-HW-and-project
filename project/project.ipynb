    "## Motivation\n",
    "- The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.\n",
    "- The task we are planning to work on is a multi label toxic comment classification problem from a Kaggle Competition by Jigsaw\n",
    "- We experimented and compared multiple models such as Logistic Regression, LSTM and Text CNN."

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to the problems is structured as follows:\n",
    "1. EDA\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "3. Models\n",
    "4. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. EDA\n",
    "- EDA notebook can be found here - [EDA](EDA.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Through EDA we found out that the dataset is highly skewed where 9.6% of the 160K comments are classified as toxic and rest as non-toxic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A severe toxic comment is always toxic and other classes seem to be a subset of toxic barring a few exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1. Word Length Distribution\n",
    "- Below plots show the total word count frequency distribution across train and test data after preprocessing.\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/word_len_dist.png\" alt=\"Word Length Distribution\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Category Distribution\n",
    "- From the category distribution venn diagram and the bar plot below we can see that the toxicity is not evenly spread out across classes i.e. classes are imbalanced.\n",
    "- Also we can see that the three major labels are:\n",
    "    - toxic\n",
    "    - obscene\n",
    "    - insult\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/label_dist.png\" alt=\"Category Distribution 1\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/label_dist_2.png\" alt=\"Category Distribution 2\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. Category Correlation\n",
    "- The category correlation plot below shows label combinations that are frequent.\n",
    "- We can deduce that `toxic` is coming in all combination.\n",
    "- Also, the number of comments for each combination drops exponentially.\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/label_correlation.png\" alt=\"Category Correlation\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4. Category Correlation Venn diagrams\n",
    "- Below venn diagrams show combinations for all labels with `toxic`\n",
