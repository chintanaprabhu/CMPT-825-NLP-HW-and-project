Downloading the dataset:

- Download the dataset from Kaggle - Toxic Comment Classification - https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

- The root directory should contain the data folder with the dataset from Kaggle. 

- Install the modules provided in the `requirements.txt`

- THE `data` FOLDER NEEDS TO PUT INTO THE `source` folder extracted from `source.zip`.

- For the `project.ipynb` to be able to display images, `Images` folder from gitlab needs be downloaded via this link - https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/krutp/nlpclass-1197-g-lexchunkers/-/archive/master/nlpclass-1197-g-lexchunkers-master.zip?path=project%2FImages

- The `images` folder should be placed inside the `source` folder extracted from `source.zip`

Here's how to run all the three models

For Logistic Regression 
- run `python3 Log_reg/log_regression.py`

For LSTM 
- Download `crawl-300d-2M.vec` and `glove.840B.300d.txt`. Put them in `data` folder
- run `python3 LSTM/LSTM.py`

For TextCNN 
- Download `crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip` and extract it in `data` folder
- run `python3 TextCNN/textCNN.py`

NOTE: If something doesn't work just clone the project directory from https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/krutp/nlpclass-1197-g-lexchunkers/tree/master/project. Word embedding still would have to be downloaded separately.
NOTE: Report file `project.ipynb` contains images so `Images` folder needs to be downloaded from gitlab

Checking the output files:
The output.zip contains all the submission predictions generated by the three models. They should be submitted to Kaggle for evaluation
